## 🛠 How It Works Behind the Scenes

Laptop-Price-Analysis uses a machine learning process called Random Forest. It looks at many examples of laptop prices and their specs and finds patterns. Once trained, it can suggest prices for new laptop specs you enter. The model’s accuracy measure (R² = 0.82) means it guesses prices closely most of the time.

You do not need to train the model yourself, as this step is already done and included.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need programming skills?**  
**A:** No. The program runs via a notebook interface that shows everything ready to use.

**Q: Can I use this on my Mac or Linux?**  
**A:** Yes. The steps are the same, but use Terminal commands in place of Command Prompt.

**Q: What if I don’t have Python installed?**  
**A:** Follow the Python installation steps in the download section. It is easy and you only do it once.

**Q: Can I use my own laptop data?**  
**A:** If you want to analyze your own dataset, you can replace the CSV files. However, this might require some technical knowledge.
